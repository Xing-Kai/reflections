How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By using diff, all the differences between the two versions will be listed.The bugs could be found by check those differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can easily roll back to the old version in case you breaks something in the new version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can decide yourself whether one commit contains the same logical topic.
    Cons: Human errors:forget to commit or commit too small or too big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because we usually use Git for programming project, which contains different files that are related.And the Google Docs fiels are usually independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log shows the commit using git diff to compare the two commit numbers to see the changes made in this commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By using version control I could go back to see which commit caused the breaking using checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To learn other interesting projects!
